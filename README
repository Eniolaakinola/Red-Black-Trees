This project demonstrates a templated Red-Black Tree implemented in C++.
A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures operations like insertion, deletion, and search are performed in logarithmic time. 
This makes it efficient for maintaining ordered datasets with frequent updates.
