This project demonstrates a templated Red-Black Tree implemented in C++.
A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures operations like insertion, deletion, and search are performed in logarithmic time. 
This makes it efficient for maintaining ordered datasets with frequent updates.

How to Run
Compile the source file:

Bash
g++ -std=c++17 "Red-BlackTrees.cpp" -o redblack

Run the executable:
./redblack
